# plrbase

Plrbase is a self-hosted solution to skill-based matchmaking, authentication, and server/lobby scaling for your game. It is currently in very early development.

# Services

The online self-hosted services are:

- Admin Panel - an admin panel to manage these various services
- Warden - the database and API for player authentication, matches, and rating calculation
- Lobby - a regional matchmaking lobby server that can be manually scaled
- [Galactus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OnoxKotPQ) - a service that automatically scales your match servers based on demand

Additionally, plugins for various game engines will be developed.

# Roadmap

- v1 - warden is working properly and a godot plugin works
